      Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are "Farmer" and "Hunter".
      The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A
      hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use
      aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers
      to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process
      is called "sales capturing". An example is a commodity sale such as a long
      distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson.
      Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who
      creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter
      the buying process.

      Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s
      efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate
      translation or to mechanically aid the human translator. More recently,
      the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide market for translation
      services and has facilitated "language localization". Ideally, the
      translator must know both languages, as well as the subject that is to be
      translated.
